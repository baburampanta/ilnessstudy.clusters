Illness Study Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the `illnessstudy.csv` dataset, leveraging Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical insights. The dataset provides valuable information about various illnesses, helping to identify patterns and draw meaningful conclusions. The project is designed for use in academic research or data analysis tasks and demonstrates the application of foundational data science techniques.

Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Refer to the "Deployment" section for information on deploying the project on a live system.

Prerequisites

You need the following software installed to run this project:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

Required Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

To install the libraries, run:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
Installing
Follow these steps to set up the project:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IllnessStudyAnalysis.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd IllnessStudyAnalysis
   ```
3. Lunch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the Notebook: Open the Data_1200.ipynb file in the Jupyter interface and run the cells sequentially.

Running the Tests

This section explains how to validate the functionality of the project.

End-to-End Tests

The notebook includes visualization and statistical tests to validate data trends and model performance. These tests ensure:

-Data is loaded and preprocessed correctly.

-Visualizations accurately represent the dataset.

Example:

Run the cell generating a heatmap to confirm correlations within the dataset.

Coding Style Tests

Python code adheres to PEP-8 guidelines. Tools like flake8 can validate the coding style.

Example:
```
pip install flake8
flake8 Data_1200.ipynb
```
Deployment

To deploy the analysis on a live system:

-Export the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML file for sharing.

-Convert the notebook to a Python script for integration into larger applications.

Built With

-Jupyter Notebook: Used for running Python code interactively.

-Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

-Matplotlib: Data visualization.
